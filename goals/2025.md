# Reflection on 2024 #
Realized that I need to work on things that I care about or else I won't do the work.
Better at relationships, not being friends with people I don't respect and being a better friend towards those that I do. 
Alot better mentally and physically than a year ago. Not smoking weed anymore, and not hating myself or confused on what I want to do. 
This past year I was really confused and broken with what I was spending my time doing and that made me very "paused" where I was doing something I didn't believe in but I was too scared for it too end. 
After this period, I also had to overcome laziness and inaction. 
I like myself waayyy more and realized a big problem I had was mental self-harm. 
Also realized that I enjoy alot of my emotions, for example getting angry about things because I'm passionate, not liking some people, being open to everybody.
Mostly this past year I've come to love myself way more and realized the toxicity of other people influencing me. 
The first 5 months I was pretty static and was looking to leave my job. The following 3 months I also didn't do much. But the following month was really fun and I went on a long bike ride and did alot of stuff.
And the following 2 months was rough because I didn't want to do anything again, but this time it also felt like recovering from weed dependence as well. This past month has been really enjoyable, especially this past week where i've become more resolute on CIA
