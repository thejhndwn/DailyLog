Lately I've been feeling more like I should get into Machine Learning. I'm sure that as I work in my career I will gravitate towards that field though. For example, one of the best ways to move ahead would be open source contribution

These last few days have been a blur, the last logs were from Thursday, probably in the morning, so I can say that I don't think much happened last week, but the good thing is that I did log these things and I did a little "research" into the onemillioncaps idea. The fault with these things is that I've been doing alot of theory and not a lot of development. I'm not sure what's been going on but I have certainly had some sort of depression, I'm not sure why, but something (my own laziness was keeping me from doing it, fear of doing work.

This week I should focus on making open source contributions and trying to get caught up on the ML work, I think that I'm draining myself trying to read from a textbook. Other than that I should also focus a bulk amount of time I'm trying to get these projects out. These are projects that I want to get out that I wouldn't have time to do if I were working. 

Anyways, besides that this weekend I've spent a LOT of time playing the game Metaphor Refantazio, it is pretty good but I've pooped myself out of the storyline playing. I need to do some stuff, I've been too afraid to do things lately.
