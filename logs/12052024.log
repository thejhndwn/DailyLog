Some thing about last night, I woke up in the middle of the night at 1, and then was up for the better part of 3-4 hours scrolling around on Twitter. I also did a bit of research but not alot. Today I'm going to be focusing on working with speed. Something good about today is that I'm not going to go for a walk at 10 since it's a little cold and my mom won't be able to join me. But I do need to operate with a little more urgency. Urgency to get things done today and to ensure that things are done in the future. I'll also start recording my weight in the morning, and if I want I can take also log pictures. But yeah
