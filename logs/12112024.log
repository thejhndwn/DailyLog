So there were some good and not so great things about this morning. The only part to improve is that I slept late (after 1) last night and woke up around 8, probably before, which means I'm operating on about 6 hours of sleep which never feels good. Yesterday was so strange, I felt a crash at around 6PM. Anyways the rest of the morning was great, I haven't eaten anything and I did do some weight lifting. I think that if I am to eat anything it should be some protein powders. I guess the only things I really have to do are go for a walk and apply for jobs at my brother's place. The rest of the day is devoted to making this avatar generator. That's incredibly freeing. 

For the rest of the day:
- figureing out additional question for generator
- researching more about 3d generation
- making a website that is capable of 3d rendering and hosting, then making an interactive ui with it. a good game to make would be that game where you harm the buddy and get money, then spend the money on getting better weapons to harm the buddy.
