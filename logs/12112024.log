So there were some good and not so great things about this morning. The only part to improve is that I slept late (after 1) last night and woke up around 8, probably before, which means I'm operating on about 6 hours of sleep which never feels good. Yesterday was so strange, I felt a crash at around 6PM. Anyways the rest of the morning was great, I haven't eaten anything and I did do some weight lifting. I think that if I am to eat anything it should be some protein powders. I guess the only things I really have to do are go for a walk and apply for jobs at my brother's place. The rest of the day is devoted to making this avatar generator. That's incredibly freeing. 

For the rest of the day:
- figureing out additional question for generator
- researching more about 3d generation
- making a website that is capable of 3d rendering and hosting, then making an interactive ui with it. a good game to make would be that game where you harm the buddy and get money, then spend the money on getting better weapons to harm the buddy.

Okay so I want to go to sleep soon so I'll try to keep this short. Basically I missed out on walking and do much work because I was constantly on Twitter and I didn't get good sleep last night so I took a long nap. So there's alot to unpack her. The sleep is essential, I'm sick of not getting enough sleep. However, the Twitter addiction is another thing. I don't know why I'm spending so much time on Twitter I think that I'm hoping that I don't miss anything or maybe there's something interesting that I want to comment or post. That's a little nonsensical, I'm literally scrolling Twitter hoping to find something interesting to read or post. The issue is that I'm not sure what to post anyways. I should look to the news for news, and I can use Twitter during those designated times, at night and during my walks. Okay so that's good, so it means that there's no reason to be on Twitter that much, and there's really no point to watching pointless things on Youtube either. 


Tomorrow I want to get a working demo of the buddy harming game, so I can publish it on Saturday. 
I definitely do want the PDF reader. It should be really similar to a code editor but I'm just not sure how it would work right now. I think that the PDF reader will have to be a "hackathon" item for next week. And this weeks hackathon item is the Interactive buddy game. Anyways yeah I'm going to bed.
