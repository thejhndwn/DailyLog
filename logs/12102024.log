so last night was okay I slept around 12 - 1, and woke up at 7AM. Right now it's just before 11AM and I've decided that I'm going to be focusing my time on 3D avatars, which I hope subsequently leads into 3D generation and some other characteristics. This area of 3D avatar generation should allow for custom media creation and should act as an engine for other online ventures, for example powering 3D avatar news anchors. Eventually this company can pivot into 3D landscape generation. 

Otherwise, this morning I ate alot for breakfast and had a cup of coffee. I don't usually have coffee but today I thought I'd delight myself with a cup as lately I've been feeling out of the saddle. I need to limit my media consumption to during my walks, it's too out of hand otherwise. That being said I don't want to work at the moment so I should go for a walk. 

Plans for today:
- plan out the 3d avatar generation
- figure out how the tech stack is going to work
- try to get something running for this Saturday
- walk 6 miles with 30 minutes of weight lifting
- limit additional calories to 1000.
