# Morning babble #
so last night was okay I slept around 12 - 1, and woke up at 7AM. Right now it's just before 11AM and I've decided that I'm going to be focusing my time on 3D avatars, which I hope subsequently leads into 3D generation and some other characteristics. This area of 3D avatar generation should allow for custom media creation and should act as an engine for other online ventures, for example powering 3D avatar news anchors. Eventually this company can pivot into 3D landscape generation. 

Otherwise, this morning I ate alot for breakfast and had a cup of coffee. I don't usually have coffee but today I thought I'd delight myself with a cup as lately I've been feeling out of the saddle. I need to limit my media consumption to during my walks, it's too out of hand otherwise. That being said I don't want to work at the moment so I should go for a walk. 

Plans for today:
- plan out the 3d avatar generation
- figure out how the tech stack is going to work
- try to get something running for this Saturday
- walk 6 miles with 30 minutes of weight lifting
- limit additional calories to 1000.

# Evening Recap #
Today was huge. I did broadscope planning for my startup, what our goals, what are products are, and got started on reading some papers about 3D generation. I cut the walk down to 5 miles, although I forget how long I spent on that, maybe 2.5 hours (yikes; intended 1.5). I've decided to name the company Celia Intelligence Anemone for the time being. It's an homage to Celia, the fairy from Phantom Hourglass, artificial intelligence, and I needed an A word so I chose anemone, but I may use Axiom in the future. I want it to acronym to CIA because that's easier to type and will probably auto correct. I've always wanted to name something with the pattern of ###col Labs, so that I could say the name also includes "Collabs", but that will have to wait. I've also decided to stop lamenting about not doing enough, it's not healthy. It's better to focus on what you've done and what you're going to do tomorrow. 

One of the best things to come out of today is that I've decided that the first product is going to be a 3D avatar generator with motion and scene capture. That will segueway into news casting and content creation nicely. I also developed some questions (and a doc) that when answered will allow me to make the generator. I really do want to release something for Saturday though I'll have to think about that more. Another thing is that I should make a schedule for the Youtube channel, I need to upload some singing and edit the travel. In addition this week I'm going to have to make social landing pages for CIA, although I'd prefer for that not to be the weekend update. Maybe I should release a game for CIA this weekend in the time being. I'll have to think about it later. 


# Tomorrow Plans #
Tomorrow I'm going to continue my research into 3D generation and answering the doc questions. Once I have those answered ASAP I should start the generator. 

For tomorrow things that i'll have to do better is to not eat chocolate or sweet Costco muffins, I stuffed my face too much today. Also I do need to do that weight lifting, which I haven't done in the last few days. I'll have to do it in the morning tomorrow. 

Tomorrow I'll also have to walk and in the evening go to my brother's house to see my niece. That's nice since tomorrow I also have to apply to jobs, so I can apply for jobs at his place. But assuming I wake at 7, work out til 8 and meander til 9. Let's assume I walk for two hours after, so it's 11. I should have a good five hours to answer those questions. The issue with solving those problems is that I really like reading ("reading") those papers. We'll see. 

This week I should make socials for CIA. The plan for CIA is that I want to release something every week. Additionally, I should upload something to my personal Youtube channel. The personal Youtube channel should also have a release schedule, at least singing should be weekly. Who knows about the rest, hopefully it comes when I get into a rhythm and don't suffer from upload paralysis. I think that I'm going to stop consuming so much from social media pretty soon. I'm having alot of fun planning CIA and my Youtube singing channel lol. 


# Thoughts on Agency #
On a separate note, something I've been thinking about since yesterday is this concept of agency. It's odd for me since I've always been lazy and prioritized fun and laughter. But things that I think are fun and silly I've been extremely agentic towards. And even things that I thought were ridiculous and at scale, like the philanthropy event I did in college, or getting high scores in meaningless video games, I did with high agency. So I know the agency exists, but I also know it doesn't emerge for this definitively "productive" things. My fatal flaw is that if I don't care, I don't care (the positive being that I know what I care about). It's also a great strength. So that's something about Cilia Intelligence Labs

# Meta thoughts on the logs#
I like how my writing is improving and I enjoy making it thematic. The issue is that it separates from the original purpose which was to make something easily read and extractable. Extractable for what was done and all that. Then again, I like reading and don't have an issue with reading (not that I've looked back on these logs...haaaa). But yeah I am feeling that it is more thematic and free flowing, rather than following a rigid todo style.
