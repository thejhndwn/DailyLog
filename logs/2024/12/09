Well today was rather uneventful, after not getting much sleep last night I took a long midday nap which I believe lasted two or three hours, with an hour of meandering. Well I woke up a little before 2 and then went on a 6 mile walk which lasted 2-3 hours and then I ate and made dinner and now it's almost 6. For the rest of the day I should apply to jobs but to be honest I'm not feeling it, although I have nothing else to do. Otherwise I can do some work on the vocaloid generator which sounds more fun, I'll try to do that but I suspect it will just devolve into trying to get my laptop to work. I do need to get started on that vocaloid thing if we're going to finish by the weekend. I decided that I must focus on making a startup and thatway it will occupy most of my time. The thing about the rest of the day is that if I want to sleep around 9, then I don't think that I'll be applying to many jobs or getting much done with the vocaloid.

I think for the rest of the day I'll just look for companies to apply to and then do some research on the vocaloid system. But yeah it is super important that I sleep on time, today and last week were kind of ruined due to not sleeping enough.
