# Reflection of the Day #
So I did a little bit of everything today, that's worth celebrating. I added the floor to the environment. I'm probably going to add some colliders as the walls and call that good. I also figured out how to code the avatar body which I'll do tomorrow, using rapier joints should make it possible. After that I'm going to have to do some research into how to make the weapons. The collision and money making system should be fairly easy with the collision listeners. Tomorrow I should be able to make the avatar and then I think we should add the GUI and money system. Then we can worry about weapons, effects, physics, and collisions. 

This week I'm not going to apply to jobs. Let's get this game working. I did write down some goals for 2025 as well. Besides the coding work, I should make the socials. Let's say that I have to make them on Wednesday. A big thing is that I need to resist the urge to use social media until I go for a walk. Besides that tomorrow morning I want to workout. And what should I do for fun? I think look for open source 3DG models to look at.

Yeah there's not much to think about tomorrow. I want to make alot of progress on teh game. Making the avatar and adding the GUI. In fact I think those things should be fairly easy. The next thing should be to add a missile model, or a "fist" model. And then to add the money and collision systems. 

I need to do more with CIA. I need to make the Twitter and the website soon. 

Tomorrow morning I'll wake up, plan my day, then read the news and workout and then start coding. My goals are to make significant progress on the interactive game and to unleash socials for the company. Lastly for my personal self I want to read more about 3DG or look at open source code for it. Maybe record a song if I have spare time. :) goodnight
