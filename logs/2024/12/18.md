Today I have to figure out what went wrong with the avatar implementation. Also I want to make the website and Twitter account today as well. Once I figure out the avatar, I'm going to create my first weapon and try to implement collisions and money generation with the GUI.

After taking a big nap, I just played Metaphor Refantazio for the whole day. I mean the start of the day was pretty good. I did all my "routine" stuff but I didn't get much in the way of true productivity. And I'm at a wall of productivity where the rest of the work is not clear. Tomorrow I need to get over what's stopping me and dive into the work. I think after today it solidifies the fact that no matter what I will be taking a nap however, it's just up to me how early that nap is. Also I should recognize that before that nap I'm not going to be able to be able to do the most productive things, so I should do the second priority items. Lastly, I think that if I do that then I should be most productive during midday and evening, which was my pattern during school. This is a process of figuring out how to do more with a limited amount of time.

The good thing is that I have the freedom to do whatever I want in that time.
