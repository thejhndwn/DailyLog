It's almost 3PM and all I've done today is wake up, workout, walk eat lunch and nap. Today I at least need to add the 3D avatar. Later today I need to make the socials for the company. A website and a Twitter account. I'm going to have to sacrifice my Twitter and Youtube time. It's taking away from my working hours.
