It's almost 3PM and all I've done today is wake up, workout, walk eat lunch and nap. Today I at least need to add the 3D avatar. Later today I need to make the socials for the company. A website and a Twitter account. I'm going to have to sacrifice my Twitter and Youtube time. It's taking away from my working hours. 

4PM 
So I tried to get the avatar to work, it's not working, but I was able to easily add the tweakpane. I am really not going to have much time left on this thing. I have a full day tomorrow and Thursday will also be a full day sans volleyball in the evening, but Friday I'll only have a half day since we're going to Orlando. I also need to plan what to do during that flying and driving down time. 

I'm pretty sad about the work that I was able to get done. Now I'm going to go see my niece, but I want to make the Twitter and website while I'm there. 

9PM 
So I did figure out some things. I'll be able to reuse the work I did on the memory game thing as the basis for CIA's website. Then I'll use a subdomain to house the actual projects, like the interactive buddy. My mom says that I should be more lenient towards people that care about me but I don't respect. I'm not so sure.
