# Rant 
You know what I got done today? I FKN DEPLOYED THE BLOG. FK ME. That took the whole day. And it took the whole day for me to just setup the nginx proxy. I don't understand how that's even possible. I largely started at noon, but it shouldn't take that long to setup nginx. FK ME. Just looking back there was a point where I was kind of just doing whatever. Stuff was happening and changing but I wasn't comprehending what was happending. 

Basically I was able to pick up the default nginx site and then I wasn't able to trasnfer that to my files. So it took me an entire day to figure out file permissions. I mean I know alot about nginx and proxy and hosting now, and that missing knowledge probably made this alot harder and mysterious. But in the future I have to understand what I'm trying to do before I waste an entire day on it, so that I can make sure that I'm walking along the right path. I definitely should have gone for a walk earlier and just reflected on the port and deployment system and then I wouldn't been confident to ignore the nginx conf file which I was scared was causing the failure. 

Next time if I'm not making progress, I need to step back and generate some questions to ask, I can't just be stabbing in the dark. and I'm using Claude from now on. At some point I have to automate the sites CI/CD. But damn I can't believe it took me the entire weekend to deploy this blog lol. I'm not a good coder right now haha but I can feel I'm getting better. Just like the guy at the gym and the people that like volleyball I have to bring energy and competitiveness to development.
