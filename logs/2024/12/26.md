# Morning Notes #
Just before 9AM EST

I woke up around 3 hours ago, just scrolling on my phone. That time could be better spent doing something else like exercise or work, but today I used it on my phone. 

So here's my situation breakdown. Tomorrow morning I'll be driving to Chicago. Tonight I want to play indoor volleyball at Hillside, and this Saturday I want to release the socials for Celia. In addition today I want to train a 3DGAN and also figure out the sphere and joint problem for Interactive Buddy.

I want to talk about why the last month or so hasn't worked and it's because I've been too soft with sleep and rest. I wouldn't work if I was tired and just wanted to rest until I napped. And I haven't been serious about getting this thing off the ground. It's time to grow the seriousness and be competitive. 

# TODO
- Make website for Celia
- Make Twitter account for Celia
- Figure out how to host the Celia site
- Develop and train the 3DGAN model
- Figure out how to make a ball and joint for Interactive Buddy


4PM EST

Some updates. So I wasn't too focused in the last 7 hours, but I still got some good work in. Importantly the ins and outs of the website are fleshed out. Tragically there still remains alot of work to be done before the release. Namely,
- Making the first blog post
- Getting Team display to work
- Adding any styling or favicons
- figure out the hosting and deployment, which ideally I should do for the rest of the day, or I can figure it out on Fri/Sat, and I will. 
- Make Twitter account...used for making slight updates, sharing and reposting content, and being another vector for discovery.

I'm going to cook and think about the first blog post, then fix the team view. Then before volleyball I'm going to try to get a 3DGAN training locally. Tomorrow I'm going to figure out the technicalities of deployment and hosting, so that Saturday I can actually deploy, make the Twitter account, try to figure out remote access to this PC from my laptop. 

LOL I just checked and there's no way I'm shelling out the money to make Twitter organizaiton. Instead I should use that Twitter account to make the News bot.

# A little before 11PM EST #
I am going to make some decisions here. No more volleyball for awhile. It's a waste of time and energy. Instead I need to lose some weight, then I'll start playing again. Today was fun getting the website to what I want. It's at a good point now. I'm going to release it Saturday once I figure out the hosting and deployment. So I should have some fun with the 3D generation and Interactive Buddy. I've also decided on holding off on making the Twitter account. I just don't see how it's going to be relevant compared to my personal Twitter account and my blog...I'll increase the vectors of interaction once I have more things to interact with. So now I should focus on Interactive Buddy, training a 3DGAN, and setting up a system for the news anchor, which is going to include the 2D map I've decided. 

I'm not sure what the end goal is here. I'm going to make this company and release these products, but none of these products are going to make money or get sold. I need to release a 3DGAN and other 3D generative models during this period so I can leverage it to make AI based content, which the generation of will be profitable. This Interactive Buddy thing is a good introduction into browser rendering. I need to start doing something with 3D generation. Then for the news thing I'll get experience running streaming data, potentially with 3D rendering. And throughout this I'm going to see if we can also make a 3D generator. After a 3D generator I"m going to make the avatar and environment generator. Also at some point I want to make a PDF translator. That should come before the end of February.
