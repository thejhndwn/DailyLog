# Morning Notes #
Just before 9AM EST

I woke up around 3 hours ago, just scrolling on my phone. That time could be better spent doing something else like exercise or work, but today I used it on my phone. 

So here's my situation breakdown. Tomorrow morning I'll be driving to Chicago. Tonight I want to play indoor volleyball at Hillside, and this Saturday I want to release the socials for Celia. In addition today I want to train a 3DGAN and also figure out the sphere and joint problem for Interactive Buddy.

I want to talk about why the last month or so hasn't worked and it's because I've been too soft with sleep and rest. I wouldn't work if I was tired and just wanted to rest until I napped. And I haven't been serious about getting this thing off the ground. It's time to grow the seriousness and be competitive. 

# TODO
- Make website for Celia
- Make Twitter account for Celia
- Figure out how to host the Celia site
- Develop and train the 3DGAN model
- Figure out how to make a ball and joint for Interactive Buddy
