# Morning Notes #
Just before 9AM EST

I woke up around 3 hours ago, just scrolling on my phone. That time could be better spent doing something else like exercise or work, but today I used it on my phone. 

So here's my situation breakdown. Tomorrow morning I'll be driving to Chicago. Tonight I want to play indoor volleyball at Hillside, and this Saturday I want to release the socials for Celia. In addition today I want to train a 3DGAN and also figure out the sphere and joint problem for Interactive Buddy.

I want to talk about why the last month or so hasn't worked and it's because I've been too soft with sleep and rest. I wouldn't work if I was tired and just wanted to rest until I napped. And I haven't been serious about getting this thing off the ground. It's time to grow the seriousness and be competitive. 

# TODO
- Make website for Celia
- Make Twitter account for Celia
- Figure out how to host the Celia site
- Develop and train the 3DGAN model
- Figure out how to make a ball and joint for Interactive Buddy


4PM EST

Some updates. So I wasn't too focused in the last 7 hours, but I still got some good work in. Importantly the ins and outs of the website are fleshed out. Tragically there still remains alot of work to be done before the release. Namely,
- Making the first blog post
- Getting Team display to work
- Adding any styling or favicons
- figure out the hosting and deployment, which ideally I should do for the rest of the day, or I can figure it out on Fri/Sat, and I will. 
- Make Twitter account...used for making slight updates, sharing and reposting content, and being another vector for discovery.

I'm going to cook and think about the first blog post, then fix the team view. Then before volleyball I'm going to try to get a 3DGAN training locally. Tomorrow I'm going to figure out the technicalities of deployment and hosting, so that Saturday I can actually deploy, make the Twitter account, try to figure out remote access to this PC from my laptop. 

LOL I just checked and there's no way I'm shelling out the money to make Twitter organizaiton. Instead I should use that Twitter account to make the News bot.
