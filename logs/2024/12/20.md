on vacation in georgia with my family and brothers family. last night we arrived at 8PM to orlando and then drove five hours to Savannah georgia. this ended up wotj us arriving at 2:30AM. And not sleeping til 4AM. then woken up at 8AM. so today ill give myself a pass on the work. 

However tomorrow is a singing day and id like to get some work done. one is work in interactive buddy. i believe im close to figuring out the colliders and joints problem. lastly i need to remake my timelines for CIA, and actuslly make the socials. lastly i want to look over the 3DGAN paper. there was alot to gather from rhe paper. if i have time i want to look for open source code projects. 

its really fun right now, I think CIA has the potential to be a large legitimate company. with good fortune its in my hands, i need to make some project timelines.
