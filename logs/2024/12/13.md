# Initial thoughts for the day # 
I'm tired for the day and I haven't showered yet. There's so many things to do today, and I just want to play some video games and not do them. Anyways I need to make an interactive environment in threejs at least today. The rest of it should be fairly easy. Later this evening I'll be attending my parents church performance which should be fun.
