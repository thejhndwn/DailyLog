It's noon and I just woke up from a nap. Today I need to make the 3D interactive buddy game, setup the socials and business for CIA, and apply to jobs. In the evening I would go to play volleyball, if there are alot of people at volleyball I could apply to jobs and setup the socials there. I should leave early so that I can submit the check.
