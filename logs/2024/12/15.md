I have fallen into playing Metaphor Refantazio. 

It's around 7PM and I'm going to play some volleyball at scraft. I've played enough of the game and tomorrow I'm going to get back to making the Interactive Buddy game. My excursion this weekend the effect of putting me back about a few days. Of course, it's logically evident, but every day pushes back realizing my company. And I've been thinking that I have a laziness problem, but I don't think that I do. In fact, when its demanded it seems that people don't work as well or as hard as I do. Certainly I'm not a very outwardly pressing person, but I am inwardly pressing, which is my competitive advantage. 

Tomorrow I'll work on getting the Interactive Buddy game working. I remember an earlier log that had the steps aligned. That introduces a mistake in my work so far, I haven't been celebrating these small stage successes and bathing in the dopamine. Since I'm behind I also need to get the socials and whatever else I had planned for Saturday working.

Things to do tomorrow 
- Figure out how to code a physics environment, with the avatar, weapons, collision detection and money/GUI system.
- Read more about 3DG, variational autoencoders, and there was recently a point cloud to mesh paper released that looked cool.
- Make Twitter and website for CIA
