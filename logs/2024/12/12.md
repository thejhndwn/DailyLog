# Thoughts on the day and work to be done #
It's noon and I just woke up from a nap. This week I need to make the 3D interactive buddy game, setup the socials and business for CIA, and apply to jobs. In the evening I would go to play volleyball, if there are alot of people at volleyball I could apply to jobs and setup the socials there. I should leave early so that I can submit the check.
Today I should finish reading the 3DG survey, then I should start coding the interactive buddy game, hopefully just figuring out how to make interactive 3D environment. Then tomorrow I can actually make the game mechanics, and maybe on Saturday work on making it available. Sometime between them I'm going to have to make the social and the business, but really importantly the socials. 

# Meta commentary on my long term goals and other work to do this week #
Sometime this weekend I'm going to have to do my 2025 goals, and my 2024 recapped. I also want to make a Spotify playlist, which I feel I haven't done in a year. And looking at my goals, it's alarming how different my goals have changed from two years ago. Because I realized that my actions weren't aligned with my long term goals, which were to make a farm and a cafe, since I could easily do that right now. And that's the thing, is that I want my long term goals to be just that, requiring years of investment, not just something to fill the time when I have nothing else to do in that period. So that was something really important for me to realize and that I was struggling with these past few years. I'm glad I had the last year to really not care and fail at my goals. Because for the four years leading up to those goals I had no goals, then I had goals, but still had bad habits, and now I'm more renewed.

Definitely my long term goal is to build a successful business. And I think that after I've done that I would easily be able to find something else to do, but while I'm young this is definitely what I need to do. In that respect I am being called out West.
