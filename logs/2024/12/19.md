I napped for so long today. I"m not even sure what happened, but I don't wnat to drink coffee anymore. I need to go on a Youtube and Twitter purge this next week. There is an issue where my brain is searching for dopamine on Youtube and Twitter. My brain is too conditioned to that dopamine-I need to remind myself that there is no dopamine to be found there.
