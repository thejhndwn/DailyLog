This morning I converted the memory website work I did and converted the IndexPage for a main landing site for Celia Intelligence Anemone. Surprisingly, even though I had a few things to eat I feel fairly full and at about 1000 calories eaten.

I still want to make the Twitter account, do some work on interactive buddy, record a song, and relearn stuff from the 3DGAN paper and look at old code
