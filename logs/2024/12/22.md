This morning I converted the memory website work I did and converted the IndexPage for a main landing site for Celia Intelligence Anemone. Surprisingly, even though I had a few things to eat I feel fairly full and at about 1000 calories eaten.

I still want to make the Twitter account, do some work on interactive buddy, record a song, and relearn stuff from the 3DGAN paper and look at old code


---

So to recap the day, i didnt make the twitter sccount but i did remake the 2025 goals, i did do some work on interactive buddy, and i did look at the 3DGAN code.

Im not sure what to do tomorrow, its so hard to code in my laptop, but i will.

what i need to do is prepare the website and twitter account for release on Saturday.
