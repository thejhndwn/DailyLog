# Updates from the plane #
6:50PM EST
On the way back from a family vacation in Florida. I had alot of fun, we were able to see lots of animals and spend time with Nora. I consider that I've finished the 3DGAN paper and I want to start implementing the paper. The space arithmetic is particularly interesting. It may be a cheap way to achieve 3D model editing. It is hard to imagine that any generation problem is not some form of latent representation problem. 

When I get back I'm going to have to finish the website and clean the Twitter account for Saturday's release. And since Friday is mostly going to be a travelling day to Chicago, I'm going to have to finish the work tomorrow. If I have any other time I want to start making an in-house 3D-VAE-GAN generator. Lastly in two more weeks I'm going to have to release the Interactive Buddy. I need to figure out how to make two spheres with a joint, preferrably this week. 

Once I figure out the sphere and joint problem I don't see there being many complications with the rest of the project. I'll just have to figure out the weapons collision problem, and then the rest should be fairly easy. I'm prepare to fork the tweakpane code so I can add restricted blades. That should allow for money integration. But it seems that I have my work cut out for me this week: (1) finishing up the website and Twitter, (2) figuring out the sphere and joint problem, and (3) creating the in-house 3D GAN generator. 

Something I read online is that I should consider that these are leisure activities. I mean the in-house GAN generator is definitely a leisure activity and the Interactive Buddy I consider more my work. But yeah I need to treat this much more seriously, and I need to even treat my leisure more seriously. I don't want to be the guy that is wasting away watching Youtube and browsing Twitter. I need to make goals for myself and push myself to hit those goals. It's too dificult to figure out when I've overstepped. I won't think about that for now. 

We're going to land shortly. After getting home I'll try to go to sleep since I should get home around 8 at the earliest. I need to get my sleep in order, but lately I've been giving it too much weight. I'm okay with taking naps, in fact I don't know how to get around taking naps.
