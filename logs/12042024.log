# one hour, one hour
# get the 3d world setup
# get the news scraping setup
* walked 3 miles at 10
* took a nap at 12 and then just scrolled Twitter for the rest of the day
* started the repo

I didn't sleep on time last night. Tonight I won't be using my phone for scrolling on Twitter and Youtube at night anymore. I definitely have a Twitter addiction.

Yeah I'm going to have to stop using my phone after 8:45, I'm already feeling tired. Today wasn't productive and yet I felt that it was productive, at least I was able to walk with my mom and go to Costco and spend time with Nora. But it wasn't productive because I used my phone late into the night which made me stay up and break my diet last night. Let's say that if I finish my stuff tomorrow that I should be able to go to volleyball

Now I'm going to make a plan for the news project

- figure out globe
- figure out mouse tracking to area 
- figure out news scraping
- figure out news db pull in mouse tracking
- figure out different views (default/news, weather/natural disasters, wars, trade?)
- figure out technical details like routing, containerization, and other stuff idk.
