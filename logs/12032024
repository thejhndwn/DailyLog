# one hour, one hour
# eight hours on world news project
# apply to jobs
* walked 6 miles
* took 2 or so naps
* spent ALOT of time on chess and twitter. 
* spent an hour or so looking up existing 3D world models

Tomorrow I"m going to limit the amount of time I spend on Youtube and Twitter and see how that improves my work. Also going to try limiting the calories I consume before then as well. For the rest of the night I"m going to limit my liquids. 

I think that while a fine-grained plan does me no good I should have a framework. For example, I usually wake up from 5-6, but from this time I'm not particularly drawn to doing anything. 
- I think that I should take the first hour of the day to read. I like to learn something first. 
- Then I can start working on coding projects
- Around now I expect it to be around 10. If the weather was good I'd like to go for a walk. I think that I will regardless.
- After the walk I should do some more project work
- Around now it should be 2, I should go for another walk, and when I return I can do weights and then eat. Then it should be around 4 or 5. 
- At this point I should do my last session of work, ending around 8.
- After which I should log my work and finish with some reading. 

The issue with the above is that I don't think it's enough time for reading. I think the first hour of the day should just be language reading and then one of the working blocks should be for reading and looking for a job. I think that it would be better to limit job applications to one day of block work. For example, Monday and Wednesday we apply to jobs. The rest can be for working. Now I want to talk about the issue of upskilling. There is a big problem I have with reading tech books and its that I don't find them enjoyable or that practical. Honestly the best way to learn may be by doing. For example Designing Data-Intensive Applications just seems unusable at the moment. Yeah it would be much more interesting to me to spend an hour reading about Deep Learning I think.
