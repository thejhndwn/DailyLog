It's the beginning of the March. Which means almost 20% of the year is now over. I want to look back on what's been going on this year

- I haven't been faithful to my exercise and dieting
- I haven't done anything in the Youtube sphere: that is singing, comedy videos, or biking videos
- I've made two coding projects, but have been lazy to continue and not consistent with it
- I haven't done anything to learn about a new language
- and lastly, I haven't been applying for jobs


SO I want to make sure that I have a good year. That means that I have to get more consistent on weekly learning languages, posting Youtube singing videos and other misc content, making coding projects in the day to day, and applying for jobs and preparing for job prep. I at least have gotten a little better about walking everyday.

SO I want to make a plan and schedule going forward to make sure that I'm consistent.
I think that weekly I should:
- post a singing Yotuube video
- have a set amount of job applications
- have a goal in mind for coding project
- and do something interactive with the langauge learning

And then everyday I want to be practicing some things about learning langauge, doing the coding projects, prepping for jobs, and doing exercise.  

Thus I want to talk about a daily and weekly schedule.
THings that I want to do in a week:
- make a singing Youtube video (wed)
- do something interactive with language (thurs and sun)
- make a coding project (fri and sat)
- make a misc Youtube video (tues)
mondays are for going through the week I guess

Then everyday I want to:
- walk in the morning, then workout or do some coding
- learn something in the morning
- practice langauge
- prep for whatever else I'm going to be doing at night
- work on the coding project
- apply for jobs
- practice for jobs

and every week I want to average 10 job applications a day, so 70 job apps per week. 

So yeah I think this is a good plan, and next Monday we can go over things. Tomorrow is a Tuesday so we're going to have to make a random Youtube video. I'm going to do that and I also want to go over my bank stuff. So yeah tomorrow I think we have a good plan, first to get up and drink water, go for a walk, and lift, or start coding stuff. I also want to take 30 minutes to an hour to learn something about coding, and then take some time to practice learning languages. We will start with trying to learn a Chinese newspaper. I'm going to try doing the learning all at once, so I should find something to learn in coding, then I should find something to learn in Chinese. Tomorrow for coding I want to learn about coding interviews and I want to learn more about current affairs in LLMs
