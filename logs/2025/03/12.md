So I have a rough ideas of the things that I care about. I want to make a schedule and goals for achieving those things

I want to be good at languages every half year
I want to post on Youtube like 2 times a week
I want to be always on the diet and exercise regiment. I want to be actively following some kind of workout plan I set
I want to make a coding project every month at least and I want to be applying. 


Anyways let's make a schedule first

6AM to 9PM 

6-7 workout 
7-8 walk
8-9 learn something
9-12 work
12 - 1 language and eat and chill
1 - 5 work 
5 - 7 FREE, language, work, TFT
7 - 9 Youtube and TFT

and yeah that would be a good plan

So the thing about today is that it is 5 PM

I just want to play TFT, record a Youtube video, and go to sleep on time. I should learn some language and do some coding.
