### today

### DONE
- Got the camera to work really well
- Got the waveshare display to work, not well and I don't think it will be the solution I want in the end, but it's good for a proof of concept. I'm not sure how to alter the display at the moment though, so that's why I say that it's not well. But I guess tmr I just have to try to get a custom display rolling and then we'll be in the money
- didn't pig out at the dinner spot

### things to improve
- sleeps been pretty bad lately
- idk bc sleep or something but I haven't been productive in the mornings. Obviously there's alot I want to do outside fo just the coding stuff and I'm just not doing it. I want to do a little more so I'm going to have to push myself to do the coding stuff
- didn't walk today which wasn't great. We can let it slide since today was a bit of a tired day but it wasn't great. The good thing is that today I didn't drink coffee - I'm just not a coffee drinker. 

### tomorrow
- Try to make custom displays on the waveshare
- Make a news collection service, deployable, and with some frequency polling
- Start working on analyzing the pi camera feed, and conditional displays
