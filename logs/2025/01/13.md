# DONE
- WeaponControls works, which separated the weapons initialization from it's update and load function, which allows us to have working activate and deactivate functions. 
- Started working on the WeaponsManager, which currently is only showing a pane of potential weapons. Still need to tie in the purchasing and weapons activation logic
- changed from collision events to contact force events
- added quaternions to the avatar model and expanded the ground
- The above work cleaned up the shooting mechanics ALOT. Now we have a good money collision detection system and the gameplay is there. The only thing missing is particles and "explosion" effects and honestly those can come after Beta. I just need to get the shop worked out and get the weapons models looking right and we'll be all set. 

### Improvements
- need to sleep earlier and use the phone and twitter less at night. I'm not even sure why I want to look at them at this point, it does feel like cheap dopamine at this point. 

# TODO
- hook up the Weapon Manager to the panes, for dyanmic weapon selection
- CD for buddy
- CD for CeliaSite

- Read about NLP
- Apply to jobs

### 10:30AM
This morning I woke up at around 6:30 and fell back asleep at 7 and woke up again at 9. Lately, I haven't been honest with my Youtube and Twitter use, because I've been more productive. But I'd like to do more. The good thing is that I'm doing much more than I was a month ago - I'm improving.

I'm not excited to do it, but I'm going to try and get the WeaponsManager working and get the Beta Interactive Buddy. It's pushed back about 2 days already. 

### 4:30PM 
We were able to get alot done. I'm about a day away from a proper Beta release. I think that after the Beta release I'll do one more Beta release before largely going hand off on the project, after the second release it will just be adding weapons models and adding cool effects like camera controls and stuff like that which I'm not really interested in doing.

Anyways I'm going to go for a walk and workout, then I'm going to buy the travel stuff for mom and read about NLP and apply to jobs. If I have time I'm going to work on the PDF design. I really need to work on this PDF translator, even if we ignore yesterday I should've worked on it today and now we're saying that tomororw will go to interactive buddy too.
