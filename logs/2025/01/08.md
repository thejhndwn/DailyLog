# DONE
- Finished brushing up on DL theory like bias, variance, activation functions, and optimizers.
- Went over the GAN generation part of the Generative DL book. I think I have a good idea of how to train and apply this thing now, as a GAN, not sure about the 3D part. 
- During the evening I kind of got my second wind and started working well again. Granted, I've just been trying to get thi deployment to work, but it's going well i think. We're pretty close.

### Improvements
- Be fast in the morning. When you get out of bed try to do things fast to get to the computer fast. 
- Timebox learning. I think today there was a lull in the learning because of wanting to nap, and the learning was important, but I don't think that sitting and staring at the textbook was doing me any good compared to asking a chatbot. So we should timebox learning a little stricter
- Otherwise I think today was really good, but there was no time to do the resume or apply to jobs, not that I feel okay to do that. But we should update it with the website and the work on the buddy and 3DG.


# TODO
Going to work on getting a 3D generator working, potentially looking at all the paradigms of 3D generation. I'm not sure what to expand this to. (1) sharing it on the web, (2) trying to find a use case to showcase on Twitter, but for now i'm not clear on how to "research" or improve the model. We could look at recent papers accepted to recent conferences and see how those are making any changes. 

Now I'm going to watch some Chinese shows and work on the CD for lokispalace and buddy. If I have other time I'm going to update my resume, then I'll apply to jobs or work on some writing. 


### buddy
- fix the potential problem of awaiting entities
- add auto aiming and weapon firing system
- check if tweakpane has locked panes, add if not
- figure out the money system with tweakpane, and how to add money from collisions

### 3DG
- train the 3DGAN
- read Text2Shape, DreamFusion, and 3DAvatar paper

### Celia 
- Improve the deployment for buddy
- Improve the deployment for CeliaSite
- Try out the lenses
- Research if the Pixel can be taken apart

### personal
- Italian lesson
- apply to MLE jobs, English teaching jobs, and Math tutor jobs
- buy tickets to Boston

# Misc

### 4:57PM
Man today was so interesting. I really enjoyed today, I definitely did more than yesterday, but have nothing to show for it. I started reading at 11:17, and I started reading about DL theory until about 1:15, when I went for a walk with mom until about 3, and then I cooked suanla soup and now it's about 5PM. 

I can't believe it. I gymmed from about 8:30 to 9:15, and then prepared some food. But there's a missing 2 hours where I'm not sure the time went. Maybe I showered and stuff and it was 10 and then cooked and then it was 11. 

While I hate to be so stingy, there is sinking time. My mornings should be efficient. Wake up, work out, shower, work, eat, work, walk. This should be very efficient. 

Tomorrow we'll aim to wake up at 6, work out and finish shower by 7, then work for 3 hours. Eat a bit, then work for another 3 hours. then walk. And then we'll reconvene. I think it's ridiculous that I spent about 3 hours to get ready in the morning and then 5 hours to learn ML theory and GAN development. 

It's a little more okay since I'm testing out a new schedule and stuff and it's still more productive than yesterday, but sheesh - I demand more. 

I'm not sure what to do for the rest of the day. I don't feel like coding the GAN anymore. And there is about 3 hours of the day left. I want to spend some on learning Italian or Chinese and look into the CeliaSite deployment and the buddy deployment. If I get those things working before 8, I'll spend the rest of the time looking for jobs.
