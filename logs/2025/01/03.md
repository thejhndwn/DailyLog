# 2:30PM

I'm not feeling particularly excited to code out the rest of this project. In that case I should work on making the 3D generator, but I'm feeling tired. I would be going to sleep in about 6 hours so there shouldn't be a pressing need to get much done today. Maybe I can just figure out how to deploy the subdomain and create the CD and then I can freely work tomorrow. 

This morning I got out of bed around 8:30 and then I started working out at 9:45, and then cooked and ate and it was noon, when I went for a walk. So much of the day was already gone by the time I opened my computer. I'm not feeling guilty about it, but I do want it to change. I mean I'm exhausted and I can't sleep, this is ridiculous. It's ridiculous for me to not treat this seriously. 

Tonight I'm going to sleep on time and today I'm going to do some work. I wanted to play TFT but I think that's going to have to wait.

I ended up just making the subdomain and deployment work, although there's no automated deployment at the moment. Now I'm going to try and get a 3D generator working based off the GAN model. We need to get this ball rollling. I should start preparing to go to sleep soon but I'm not feeling too tired. I hope that I can sleep soon despite the coffee.
