### Improvements


# TODO
Today I plan to make headway on Interactive Buddy. I don't have other plans besides volleyball and learning Chinese today. If there's time I want to train the GAN and read up on the other papers. Particularly I want to look into VAE and Diffusion. 

I did make some progress on the buddy controls, we're shooting, and aiming. Slight visual bugs, but nothing unfixable. The bigger concern is that i'm not sure how to pick up collisions at the moment. I really should've just went though weapon models earlier today, but instead I haphazardly tried to make collision detection work. 

I have about an hour before volleyball, I want to rest, but if I'm not going to rest I should train the 3DGAN. I might just do that. At volleyball I can do some reading on 3D generation. 

Tomorrow I'm going to work on the collision detection and train the GAN. For fun I'm going to try to fix the deployment for CeliaSite and buddy. I completely forgot the buddy deployment and we're going to need it for a Saturday release. 

### buddy
- fix the potential problem of awaiting entities
- add incrementing to the collision
 - and particles
 - and reload
- add a bunch of weapon models
- correct the relative positioning of the missile
- check if tweakpane has locked panes, add if not
- figure out the money system with tweakpane, and how to add money from collisions
- how to port to oculus, or check controls work on oculus browser

### 3DG
- train the 3DGAN
- read Text2Shape, DreamFusion, and 3DAvatar paper

### Celia 
- Improve the deployment for buddy
- Improve the deployment for CeliaSite
- Try out the lenses
- Research if the Pixel can be taken apart

### personal
- Chinese lesson
- apply to MLE jobs, English teaching jobs, and Math tutor jobs
- Make a PDF translator
