# DONE
- colliders with weapons
- added skins to the avatar, but they're not angled correctly, and right now there's nothing specific to the members of the avatar, but the important part is that we have skins!
- decided on simpler controls, no controls, and instead just autoaiming for the user with no gravity or anything. We can focus on adding weapons and getting the systems working. Still need to add the aiming system and the collision system


# TODO

### buddy
- add auto aiming and weapon firing system
- check if tweakpane has locked panes, add if not
- figure out the money system with tweakpane, and how to add money from collisions

### 3DG
- read Generative AI section for general development and the part on GAN training
- train the 3DGAN
- read Text2Shape, DreamFusion, and 3DAvatar paper

# Misc

I want to talk about my thoughts lately about optimizing my life. Obviously I've been a little vacant, at least it feels vacant. For example, even though I've pretended to do stuff, in the last week I haven't done much. And lately exercising has been helping alot but I still feel like time is passing by quickly, and so I've been looking for a ways to optimize my life to draw out as much of that time as possible.

I don't think naps are avoidable anymore. I mean if they are that's great, but it seems that I'm stuck with the napping gene. If that's the case I have to realize that I love to take naps in the morning and work around that. For example I have to figure out a system to not overeat and probably indulge in less carbs and sugars. Another example is that I should spend my mornings doing less "grindy" things which I find to be unbearable if I'm tired. 

One of the biggest things is that when I'm tired or going to nap, then I won't do anything and instead settle for unproductive things. I"m not longer getting any enjoyment from casually browsing Youtube. Twitter has for the most part been solved, but I still get the feeling that I'm missing out on consumption and tha'ts why I resort to Youtube. I guess my issue is that I don't know what to consume besides Youtube. I need to consume other better things than scrolling on Youtube lol.
