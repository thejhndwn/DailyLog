# 258

# DONE
- colliders with weapons
- added skins to the avatar, but they're not angled correctly, and right now there's nothing specific to the members of the avatar, but the important part is that we have skins!
- decided on simpler controls, no controls, and instead just autoaiming for the user with no gravity or anything. We can focus on adding weapons and getting the systems working. Still need to add the aiming system and the collision system


# TODO

### buddy
- add auto aiming and weapon firing system
- check if tweakpane has locked panes, add if not
- figure out the money system with tweakpane, and how to add money from collisions
