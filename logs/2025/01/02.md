## 5:38 PM 
Man I didn't feel that good today. Last night I slept at around 5PM and was kinda asleep until midnight. Just really groggy and out of it. I did drink a fair bit. So last night I was on my phone until around 4AM when I went to sleep again. So there was alot of sleep. On that note i'm feeling some heart pangs again. Pretty spooky. I'll attribute it to sleep, lack of exercise, and drinking alcohol. 

That's to say that I don't feel top notch today and I slept alot, so am fairly rested. But all things considered it was a good day. I worked out in the morning, walked in the afternoon and worked on IB, just adding the avatar joints and a missile model. 

There's still so much work to be done, for IB and for the research part of Celia. And personally I want to learn a language. So while I'm happy for the work that was done today, I think improvements should be considered for tomorrow.

One thing is language. I'm never going to learn a new language at this rate, I'm not treating it nearly seriously enough. And I'm never going to train a 3D generator either. Tomorrow morning I'm going to workout, then focus on learning Italian for an hour. Then the evening will be spent working on the 3D generator, no matter what work remains for IB.

And I'm going to release the beta version on Saturday no matter what either. At least I need to practice hosting a subdomain.

The larger issue is that when I want to relax I resort to Twitter and Youtube. I'm not sure how to remove these, but even doing nothing for 15 minutes sounds better than those things now that I think about it. Then I should add that another goal for 2025 is to stop resorting to quick dopamine from Youtube and Twitter. 

I'm going to go to volleyball and spend the downtime reading papers. I'm not sure what to do until then though. I just want to go on Youtube and Twitter.
