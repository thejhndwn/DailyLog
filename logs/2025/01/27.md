# DONE last few days
- Worked on the MR glasses. All the consituent parts are there, except the mic and speaker. I think it should be as simple as loading up the software. Aiming for a chess player and a classifier. 
- Helped at MITRealityHacks. Saw alot of cool stuff, the coolest being with hardware. 
- Relaxed and talked to alot of people

# Today
I've been kind of MIA lately. But there are a few good things. I realize that I need to be doing alot more. Looking at these people in RealityHacks, I'm not anywhere less than them, in fact I think that I'm better than them and i want people to know it. 

One thing is that I know I can quickly finish the MR glasses. I'm planning to finish those when I get back home. Before then, this week I plan to set everything up to get the news bot going that I wanted - at the very least it should be able to make videos like moistKritikal. I want to make this type of thing because I think it should be a good project for MLE applications. Another thing is that I want to get started on working on SOTA reasoning models. I've been avoiding it, but I'm really not too interested in making generative models. The only application I care about is for world generators, but I feel it's basically solved with Minecraft. Otherwise generative models also interest me in creating an AI studio but I think it should be more about making the agents communicate, rather than any one model.

I guess ultimately something that I would be interested in doing is having an AI companion with the MR glasses I'm goign that coudl be computed locally in the glasses to make the response fast. 

So that's the state of what I want to do. Large scale I want to work on SOTA models and make ML - powered applications, the large scale projects I'm thinking are an avatar creator studio, and anime studio, and a world news outlet.
