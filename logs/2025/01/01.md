It's the turn of the year. Yesterday I didn't get much "work" done but I still did a decent amount of work. Cleaned up some projects and scripting away some tedium. I also practiced some vim in the process. 

Today I figured out the ball and joint problem, a few days past schedule. Yesterday I shoudl've finished the avatar, but luckily I gave myself this reprieve, and I should be able to finish the avatar today.

After that comes the hard part - making the first weapon and making sure the collision is up to par, and making hooks for the collision. Another good thing about this project is it pushes you to use version control :)

Separately, I want to train a 3D GAN today. I mean that's all my projects, making IB and a 3D Generator, then on the side I want to read papers and learn some Italian. I should also stretch and go for a walk today. Pretty full day considering I have to hang with my niece as well. 

I am really grateful and lucky. Let's make CIA a success
