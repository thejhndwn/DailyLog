Feeling tired this morning and drinking a harder cup of coffee. Going to train the model today and test in a hosted environment. 

I haven't done anything lol just learning about 3D in pytorch. I did start working on the training.py, but am stuck on the dataset loading stuff now. I mean it's just alot of learning. At least I want to release a hosted 3D generator online this weekend, even if the model is shite. 

I'm not sure what to continue doing. I even think that making a 3D avatar news anchor is more interesting than the PDF translator honestly. Okay by this weekend I make a 3D avatar generator and a 3D text and iamge to generator on on a website, evne if the models are shite,

Then this weekend I work on how to improve the models, and work on the CD for buddy and lokispalace, and maybe add more weapons to Interactive Buddy. 

Next week I want to continue to make a better 3D generators, but before I leave I want to release a news anchor thing. 

Now, the thing about Celia is that I'm supposed to make VR glasses and a 3d Generator and then a PDF translator. Honestly I'm not interested in the PDF translator, just as a personal project to learn Chinese.
