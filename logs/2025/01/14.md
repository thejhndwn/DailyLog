Today I woke up at 7:30, started workout at 8:25 and worked out til 9:10, and finisehd mmaking breakfast at 9:40. So we can see that we wasted an hour in bed.

I'm kind of drinking coffee, browsing the web and drinking coffee. Today I'm going to make the final push for Interactive Buddy before I call the project quits and move onto something else. I'm not too sure what to move onto - I want to make a PDF translator, but it has nothing to do with 3D generation. And the biggest blocker is that I'm not sure how pdf reading is going to work with translation, like what I really want is a chrome extension. I guess I'll think about it after I finish the Buddy stuff. i'm goign to shower and start working on the buddy stuff. 

After looking at Boston wtuff with mom and scrolling Twitter more, now it's almost 12. I don't like that it took so much time. 

So today was a good work day I guess. I basically spent alot of time prepping to release the Interactive buddy and now I released the beta. I'm going to have to add more weapons models, and fix the few visual bugs, but it's in a good spot now and I can move on to other projects.

I think I should try out the 3D generation and make it available on the web and try it out with the Oculus. This is in preparation for the RealityHacks coming up. 

I'm really happy that I could finish this semi-big project. I really did learn alot about 3JS and Rapier and even hosting websites and stuff.
