# Misc
So the thing about today. Was that after looking at the Buddy code, it is going to be a bit of work to decipher and test all the missile aiming code and stuff. It's not as simple as we thought. Afterwards I tried to get some work done on the website deployment stuff, and it's still not clear to me how to deploy - we were able to get a deployment out, but retracing the steps didn't reproduce it. 

Afterwards I took a walk and then overate and took a nap. This next week I'm going to operate without taking a nap, and optimize for not taking a nap. If this next week doesn't calibrate well, then I'm just going to take a nap for the rest of my life and plan around that. 

But there is a bigger problem at play, and that's that I'm not giving these projects my full consideration. I think tomorrow we should spend making a generator. The buddy project is kind of wearing on me, and I think it's more something to do later in the day. 

So tomorrow I'm going to largely spend on making a generator. If I have any other time I'm going to look into getting this mini OLED to work and look into breaking apart this Google Pixel. Or I think that we should save that for Saturday. In any case, the buddy code is starting to feel like a slog. 

Tomorrow I'm going to work on the generator, and hopefully between now and Saturday I get the enthusiasm to finish IB. Then on Saturday I'm going to work on the lens. 

Lastly, I need to make a plan for applications and learning Italian. I'm really not sure, maybe spending the end of the day is good for learning Italian, but this week I'll spend some time on Sunday and Saturday applying to jobs. 

One thing I want to say is that it's the end of the first week of 2025, and I haven't spent any time learning Italian. It is definitely a goal of mine to learn Italian this year and go to Italy next year. Also I haven't been as fluidly productive as I've wanted to be this year. Hopefully this context switch will help with that.
