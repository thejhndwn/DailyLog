# 256

# DONE
- added collision detection and introduced the money system to the Pane. 
- made a promo video about the above, got a like

### Improvements
To improve was I woke up late and then drank coffee to make up for the lack of quality sleep. That was actually a good thing, but I have to sleep on the correct circadian rhythm or else I'll feel tired. 

Next was that I got a great success early in the day. After that I should've gone for a walk or something cause after I got the collision detection and the tweakpane going I was just browsing the web for a few hours. I should've gave myself a productive reward rather than tried to plow through continuing the work. But that also shows that after I get a win I should give it the appropriate celebration and then continue, otherwise I'll blow all the time on a shitty celebration. 

The mornings are getting faster. The midday productivity may be a little lacking. Today I just spent a good portion of the time making the promo video. I think that we may have to go for earlier walks or actually commit to doing a different thing.

I should think about ways to improve the midday productivity slump. However, it is definitely getting better. Some things to improve on are that I'm getting tired and purposefully eating carbs during the midday, which I need to phase out. I need to commit to not taking naps and be consistent with that. 

# TODO

# Tomorrow
- add new models to IB
- look into dynamic panes, otherwise we need to make a plugin
- hook up the Weapon Manager
- CD for buddy
- CD for CeliaSite

- Read about NLP
- Apply to jobs


### buddy
- fix the potential problem of awaiting entities
 - and reload
- add a bunch of weapon models
- correct the relative positioning of the missile
- check if tweakpane has locked panes, add if not
- how to port to oculus, or check controls work on oculus browser

### pdf translator
- read about NLP translation and using HuggingFace
- Draft up how the PDF translator will work, make a design

### 3DG
- train the 3DGAN
- read Text2Shape, DreamFusion, and 3DAvatar paper

### Celia 
- Improve the deployment for buddy
- Improve the deployment for CeliaSite
- Try out the lenses
- Research if the Pixel can be taken apart

### personal
- Chinese lesson
- apply to MLE jobs, English teaching jobs, and Math tutor jobs
- Make a PDF translator


# Misc

Today we detected collisions, then worked on picking up the money var in the tweakPane and now we're just going to work on improving the tweakPane and then the game should basically be done. Just need to figure out the reload, and that would technically be a pretty good Beta, except for the model rotation.

The next release will be about adding particles and fixing some bugs, like the model rotation and initial money/collision problem. But yeah the next release should also include making different types of weapons besides all flying rockets basically, like introduciung gravity/weights, melee weapons, and just adding effects to weapon models. The release after that is probably about adding new controls and aiming for the weapons and also adding camera following and different environments and stuff like that. I'm not sure how much I'm going to work on this after Saturday though, I'm not that interested to keep working on these releases to be honest. I want to move onto more MLE stuff.

Tomorrow I'll work on the weaponsManager and Celia deployment stuff. If I can solve all of that then I'll do GAN training stuff or maybe work on the PDF translator
Today I should add new models and get the tweakPane working with locked panes and add the payment system.
