Today I woke up at 7:30 and started working out at 8:35. Then I worked out and cooked and ate and showered and now it's 10:46. So not a "fast" morning. And I mean that's to be expected since I slept at 1:30 last night, so I'm not lowering my expectations for today.

Today I want to get a 3D generator working and deployed online.

# DONE

### Improvements
- get better at going from bed to working out, try drinking water first thing, then laying in bed. 
- no more phone after 10PM, it's too much.
