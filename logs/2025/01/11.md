# Misc
### 4:24PM 
I'm not feeling like working. The WeaponsManager will take a bit of work. I think today if I can automate the deployment and add some new models that will be pretty good. I could look into dynamic blades for tweakpane.

From now on if I don't have a great purpose to go to volleyball then I'm not going. I need to go and play with a purpose, otherwise it's not going to be fun and honestly a waste of time. I could've finished alot of coding and played video games and not been as tired in that time. 

### 8:31PM 
So I didn't get anything done. That's alright. I'm going to try and automate the buddy deployment and call it a day.
