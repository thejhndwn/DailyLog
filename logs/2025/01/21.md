# DONE
- for the last two days or so I've been reading up on 3D generation, particularly VAEs and Diffusion. 
- Yesterday I made ssh possible from local network
- Today I secured my linode server more
- Today I thought that I don't really care that much about scene generation. Really it's derivative of Minecraft. I think I should focus on the Avatar generator with the Studio
- later I'd like to make scene generation for history and world stuff, but for now I don't think it's that interesting or feasible.
