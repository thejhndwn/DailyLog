# DailyLog
Here you can find a daily log of things that I've been doing. 

## Why a daily log?
I need a daily log in order to keep track of the work I'm doing. I found out its the best way to keep myself accountable to the work I want to do, otherwise I might waste away on a couch somewhere...

## Why make it public? 
I think there should be alot to learn from these daily public logs that other people may find useful in the future. I've kept a journal and a private logs from time to time and I'm at a point where I want and need the social contract of keeping a daily log to keep myself accountable. While I like to write, I am again very lazy.
