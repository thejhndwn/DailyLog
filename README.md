# Daily Log
Here you can find a daily log of things that I've been doing. 

## Why a daily log?
I need a daily log in order to keep track of the work I'm doing. I found out its the best way to keep myself accountable to the work I want to do, otherwise I might waste away on a couch somewhere...

## Why make it public? 
I think there should be alot to learn from these daily public logs that other people may find useful in the future. I've kept a journal and a private logs from time to time and I'm at a point where I want and need the social contract of keeping a daily log to keep myself accountable. While I like to write, I am again very lazy.

# TODO
- make blog post about 2024 in review and 2025 goals
- unify the two scripts cd month and vim today - rn the startup commands are different
- fix the today.sh so it makes the directory before creating the file when necessary, rn the saving will fail bc the directory may not exist
